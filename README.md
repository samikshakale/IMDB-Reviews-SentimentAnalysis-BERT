# IMDB-Reviews-SentimentAnalysis-BERT

This project aims to train deep learning models on imdb movie review data to classify overall sentiment. It uses a popular and efficient pretrained NLP model called BERT, developed by Google, to extract key features of the text data.

# Technologies/Framework Used

This project was built with Jupyter notebook using python. Some of the necessary libraries were transformers, scikit learn, torch, and pandas.

# Features

A novel aspect my project is its ability to use BERT on longer text data by extracting only key words from each review to use for training. Additionally, this project trains 3 ML models on the data allowing for comparison across a variety of models.

# How to Use

In order to run the jupyter notebook, where the code for training the model is stored, you will need to download the adjectives and adverbs text files as well as have a dataset file consisting of 2 columns saved in the csv format. Then, you can simply run the notebook and view its output.
